/*
Push_back: 
1. Push_back adds a new element at the end. 
2. It first creates a temporary object by calling a constructor.

Emplace_back: 
1. It also Inserts a new element at the end. 
2. It does not create a temporary object. The object is directly created in the vector. 
3. Due to this, the efficiency is increased.

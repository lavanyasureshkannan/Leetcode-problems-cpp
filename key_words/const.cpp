// Whenever const keyword is attached with any method(), variable, pointer variable, and with the object of a class it prevents that specific object/method()/variable to modify its data items value.
// 1. Constant Variables
// 2. Const Keyword With Pointer Variables
//      When the pointer variable point to a const value
//      When the const pointer variable point to the value
//      When const pointer pointing to a const variable
//      Pass const-argument value to a non-const parameter of a function cause error
// 3. Constant Methods
// 4. Constant Function Parameters And Return Type
//      For const return type
//      For const return type and const parameter


// PROPERTIES OF CONST
// 1. const variable needs to be declared.
// 2. "const data_type* name_of_the_pointer" => When a pointer is pointing towards that const variable -> the value of the variable cannot be changed. 
// 3. "data_type* const name_of_the_pointer" => When you want to change the variable that has a pointer pointing towards its memory address
// 4. "const int* const z" => when a const pointer pointing towards const variable => So, you are neither allowed to change the const pointer variable(*P) nor the value stored at the location pointed by that pointer variable(*P).
// 5. Passing const argument value to a non-const parameter of a function isnâ€™t valid it gives you a compile-time error.
// 6. Like member functions and member function argument object can also be declared as const.
//          When a function is declared as const, it can be called on any type of object, const object as well as non-const objects.
//          Whenever an object is declared as const, it needs to be initialized at the time of declaration 
// 7. Const member function as class
